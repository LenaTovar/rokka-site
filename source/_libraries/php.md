## PHP Library

The PHP library provides api clients for user/organization management and for uploading images and managing stacks.

Find setup instructions in the [rokka/client readme file](https://github.com/rokka-io/rokka-client-php).

## Symfony Bundle

The rokka PHP library is integrated into Symfony with the RokkaClientBundle. It provides you with configuration and provides the management and the image client as services.

Find setup instructions in the [RokkaClientBundle readme file](https://github.com/rokka-io/rokka-client-bundle).

## Module for Drupal 7

The rokka PHP library is integrated into Drupal with the rokka module. It allows to automatically upload images from fields to Rokka, synchronizes Drupal "Image Styles" to Rokka stacks and can list images from a rokka organization.

Find setup instruction and further documentation on the [rokka Drupal module page](https://www.drupal.org/project/rokka).

Note: Contact us if you need a Drupal 8 module, we would be happy to rewrite the module for Drupal 8.
